Python version 3.8.8.
The root contains the folder as follows:
    - Model - consists of save model parameters.
    - Data - consists of images and annotations for train, validation, and testing.
    - Test - consists of .py script, which will create model load pre-trained weights and test that against the test dataset.
    - Code - consists of three files -
                - ResNet.ipynb training file for ResNet.
                - AlexNet.ipynb traning file for ResNet.
    - requirment.txt - consists of all dependencies required to run the code.
    - report.pdf - consists of report of the project

To run the project -
step-1 open prompt in the root. Make sure to Install Python version 3.8.8
step-2 Install all dependencies from  Requirment.txt
            pip install -r Requirment.txt
step-3 change the directory to Test
            cd Test
step-4 run the "modelname.py" script to test that model against the test data
            python "modelname.py"
        e.g - python ResNet.py
        e.g - python AlexNetNet.py
